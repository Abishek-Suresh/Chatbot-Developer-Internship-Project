# Chatbot Project - Hotel Booking
This project is based on the Hotel booking business use case. Using the RASA framework, Iâ€™ve built a chatbot that can assist the consumer to book rooms. This chatbot can store the necessary information needed for booking a room, in a MySQL database. Also, it can answer frequently asked questions regarding the hotel. eg: About the available room types, contact number, canceling policy and canceling reservation info, etc.
